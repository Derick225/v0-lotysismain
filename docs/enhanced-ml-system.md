### Hybrid Ensemble Architecture

The system uses a sophisticated ensemble approach:

1. **Individual Model Predictions**: Each algorithm generates independent predictions
2. **Feature Fusion**: RNN-LSTM temporal patterns and Monte Carlo probabilities serve as XGBoost features
3. **Meta-Learner**: Logistic regression combines predictions with learned weights
4. **RL Adjustment**: Reinforcement learning agent dynamically adjusts model weights

## Data Pipeline

- Sequential formatting for temporal models
- Draw type encoding and date feature extraction

### Feature Engineering
- **Temporal Features**: Historical sequences with configurable windows
- **Statistical Features**: Mean, std, skewness, kurtosis, entropy
- **Pattern Features**: Consecutive numbers, arithmetic progressions, prime numbers
- **Correlation Features**: Cross-correlation between draws
- **Cyclical Features**: Day of week, month, seasonal patterns
- **Derived Features**: Hotness, coldness, momentum, volatility

### Training Pipeline
1. **Data Validation**: Ensure sufficient historical data (minimum 50 draws)
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extract comprehensive feature sets
3. **Model Training**: Train each algorithm independently
4. **Meta-Learner Training**: Learn optimal combination weights
